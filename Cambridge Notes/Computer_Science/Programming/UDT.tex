    \section{Introduction}
    Notes of things that I wasn't too sure about for this part of the course.

    \section{Non-composite datatypes}
    \subsection{Enumerated}
    An Enum is a list of possible values. In pseudocode, it's defined like so:

    \begin{center}
        TYPE $<$identifier$>$ $=$ (value1, value2, $\cdots$) 
    \end{center}

    You can use maths operators on value1, value2.... An Enum type has a name, an underlying data type (can be another UDT, or just INTEGERS) and also a set of members.

    \subsection{Pointers}
    Pointers are defined like so:

    \begin{center}
        TYPE $<$identifier$>$ $=$ \^{}$<$Typename$>$
    \end{center}

    A pointer carries an $\textbf{address}$ in memory. Typename can be any type stored at an address (INTEGERS, REALS, UDTs).

    A pointer is like the page number of a book. Dereferencing that pointer is like flipping to that page, and reading the contents. To dereference, you do: 

    \begin{center}
        $<$variable$>$ $\leftarrow$ $<$PointerIdentifier$>$\^{} 
    \end{center}


    \section{Composite Datatypes}
    \subsection{Records}
    Properties in records type are accessed by the dot notation. 

    \subsection{Sets in Python}
    $\mid$ is the union and $\&$ is the intersection.
