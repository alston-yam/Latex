    \section{Introduction}
    Database management system (DBMS): responds to queries by extracting information from the database.

    \subsection{Terminology}
    
    $\textbf{Record:}$ Storage representation of a row of data

    $\textbf{Tuple:}$ Specifically in a relational database, tuple is one row of data.

    $\textbf{Field/Attribute:}$ Field is a column, attribute is a characteristic that describes an entry in the database.

    $\textbf{Primary key:}$ An attribute in the table that uniquely identifies an entry in that table.

    $\textbf{Foreign key:}$ An attribute in a table that is the primary key of another table.
    
    $\textbf{Compound key:}$ Like an composite key (needs 2+ fields), but it's a combination of $\textbf{foreign keys}$ in a table that uniquely identifies a row.

    \section{Relational Database vs File Based Systems}

    File based systems store all data in one singular table. This leads to $\textbf{redundancies}$ in data, as the same thing might appear in multiple entries of the database. Thus this means there's a waste of space, as well as wasting time to edit these duplicate data.

    The solution is a relational database. Here there are MULTIPLE tables in the database, and they have relationships. These tables are linked by $\textbf{primary keys}$ and $\textbf{foreign keys}$.
