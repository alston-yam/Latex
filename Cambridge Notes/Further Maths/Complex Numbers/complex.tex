    \section{Summations}
    We use De Moivre's Theorem to get $z^n = cis(n\theta)$ and also $\frac{1}{z^n} = z^{-n} = cis(-n\theta) = \cos(n\theta) - i\sin(n\theta)$. Then, we can sum or subtract these two statements to get:

    \begin{theorem}[Formulae]
        \[z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} = 2\cos(n\theta)\]
        \[z^n - \frac{1}{z^{n}} = 2i\sin(n\theta)\]
    \end{theorem}

    Now, for evaluating things such as $\int\cos^4(\theta)$, just use the formula for $n=1$ first, then raise it to the 4th power. Expand the bracket in $z$, and then group the $z^n$ terms. 

    \[\cos^4(\theta) = (z + \frac{1}{z})^4 = z^4 + 4z^2 + 6 + 4z^{-2} + z^{-4} = 2\cos(4\theta) + 8\cos(2\theta) + 6\]

    \subsection{Summation of Trig Functions}
    If it's a summation in cos, realise that you can turn it into the REAL parts of the summation of a sequence in $z$, which is very easy to calculate as a geometric series. Then turn it back to $z = cis(\theta)$ or $z = e^{i\theta}$ and get the real part. Similarly for summation in $\sin$.

    \begin{problem}
        Determine the value of $\displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}2^{-n}\sin\left(\frac{n\pi}{2}\right)$
    \end{problem}

    Consider the series $\displaystyle\sum_{n = 0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{z}{2}\right)^n$. We actually just want the real part of this series, evaluated at $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$. 

    \[\displaystyle\sum_{n = 0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{z}{2}\right)^n = 1 + \frac{z}{2} + \frac{z^2}{4} \cdots = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{z}{2}} = \frac{2}{2 - z}\]

    Now, let $z = e^{i\theta}$, $\frac{2}{2 - z} = \frac{2}{2 - e^{i\theta}}$. Multiply top and bottom by $2 - e^{-i\theta}$ and we have $\frac{2}{2 - z} = \frac{4 - 2e^{-i\theta}}{5 - 4\cos{\theta}}$. Im$\left(\frac{4 - 2e^{-i\theta}}{5 - 4\cos{\theta}}\right) = \frac{2\sin{\theta}}{5 - 4\cos{\theta}}$, so just substitute $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$ to get the answer.
