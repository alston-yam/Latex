    \section{Basic Stuff}
    To get to the CDF, you would integrate the PDF.


    \section{Calculating Expected Value for a CRV}
    
    \begin{theorem}
    \[E(X) = \displaystyle\int_{\forall x} xf(x) dx\]
    \[E(g(X)) = \displaystyle\int_{\forall x} g(x)f(x) dx\]    
    \end{theorem}

    This is just the occurance $\times$ the probability of occuring.

    \section{Changing Variables}

    To go from one PDF to another, you must go through the route that is the CDF.

    \begin{theorem}
        \[f(x) \implies F(Y) \implies G(Y) \implies g(y)\]
    \end{theorem}

    In other words, we have
    \[P(Y \leq y) = P(H(X) \leq y) = P(X \leq H^{-1}(y))\]

    So we just need to undo the function that is applied to the $X$. Special care needs to be taken when handling domains. If we have $a \leq x \leq b$, then we would have $a \leq H^{-1}(y) \leq b$. Then you undo.
