    \section{Introduction}
    Notes for chromatography in the 9701 Chemistry course.


    $\textbf{Mobile Phase}$: The solvent.

    $\textbf{Stationary Phase}$: The thing not moving that the mobile phase passes through. 

    $\textbf{Partition (Coefficient)}$: Separation due to $\textbf{solubility}$ of solute between the mobile phase and the stationary phase.

    
    \section{Paper Chromatography}

    The mixture is separated by partition. The difference in solubility of the compound in the mobile and stationary phase leads to the separation.

    Consider the $R_f$: retardation factor

    \[R_f = \frac{\text{Distance travelled by solute}}{\text{Total distance from baseline to solvent front}}\]

    Different substances would have different $R_f$ values and you can just check your experimental data with known values.

    \subsection{Two Way Chromatography}
    If you go up one way and the solutes aren't that separated, turn the paper 90 degrees and do the thing again with a different solvent.

    
    \section{Thin-layer Chromatography (TLC)}
    Now the stationary phase is not a sheet of paper, but it's a solid. Normally it's $\ce{Al2O3}$ or $\ce{SiO2}$

    The mobile phase passes OVER the stationary phase, and the solid $\textbf{absorbs}$ molecules of the compound. So if both the molecule and the solid are polar, they would attract more strongly and so the molecule would travel less.


    \section{Gas Liquid Chromatography (GLC)}
    \begin{center}

    \end{center}

    Vaporised sample is carried by an inert gas (mobile phase) over a liquid (stationary phase).

    A non-polar stationary phase means that travel time is mainly determined by volatility, a polar stationary phase means polar molecules will be slowed down (so polarity also is a factor).
    
    GLC is used to determine $\textbf{\% composition}$ of a compound. The percentage is the ratio of a particular triangular peak in relation to the total area of all triangles.

    \section{Summary}
    Paper chromatography works by partition.

    TLC works by absorption.
    
    GLC works by partition.
