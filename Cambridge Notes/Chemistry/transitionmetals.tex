    \section{Introduction}
    My compiled notes for the transition metal section of the CAIE 9701 Chemistry course.

    \section{Transition Element Basics}
    \begin{definition}[Transition Element]
        A transition element is a d-block element that forms one or more stable ions with an incomplete d subshell.
    \end{definition}

    Notice that Scandium ($\ce{Sc}$) and Zinc ($\ce{Zn}$) are therefore $\textbf{NOT}$ transition elements.

    The variable oxidation states of the transition elements comes from the similar energy in the $3d$ and $4s$ orbitals, so there are many options of number of electrons to remove to end up at a stable ion.

    For the transition metals, as they go across the row, the most common oxidation state becomes $+2$. This is due to the fact that the $3d$ sub electrons are more stable. 

    \subsection{Cause of Colour}
    When ligands are attached to a transition element, the d-orbitals are split into two non-degenerate orbitals of different energy levels. Electrons absorb energy to jump up the orbital, and when they come down they release the excess energy in the form of light. The $d_{x^2 - y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals have different energy than the other 3.

    \section{Complex Ion Formation}
    \begin{definition}[Ligands]
        A species that contains a lone pair of electrons that forms a dative (coordinate) bond with a central transition element.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}[Complex Ion]
        A complex ion is an ion formed by a central transition element surrounded by one or more ligands.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}[Coordination Number]
        A coordination number of a complex ion is the number of dative bonds to the central transition element.
    \end{definition}

    \subsection{Isomerism}
    Complex ions can form geometric or optical isomers. Generally, optical isomers happen when a transition element is bonded to 3 bidentate ligands. The Cis-Trans isomers happen when there are more than one type of ligands bonded to a central atom.

    \section{Stability Constants}
    $K_{stab}$ is just another form of an equilibrium constant and it's calculated in the same way as the other ones. The higher a $K_{stab}$ is, the more stable the complex ion.
