    \section{Introduction}
    Inspired by \href{https://web.evanchen.cc/static/mop/mockimo/2020.pdf}{problem 4} on this IMO mock by Evan Chen.

    \section{Cross Ratios}
    \begin{definition}[Cross Ratios]
        Given 4 distinct points $A, B, C, D$ on a line, the cross ratio $(A, B; C, D)$ is defined as \[(A, B; C, D) = \frac{AC \cdot BD}{BC \cdot AD}\]
        Where the lengths are taken to be directed $(XY = -YX)$.
    \end{definition}

    We can actually extend the definition of the cross ratio to not just points on a line, but also four points on a conic $\gamma$ (the most commonly used conic in Olympiad geometry is a circle), and also a \textit{pencil} of lines through a particular point. In the latter case $A, B, C, D$ will correspond to lines rather than points.

    In the case of a pencil, the cross ratio can actually be thought of as the ratio of the sines of the angles between these four lines. 

    \section{Projective Transformations}

    A \textit{projective transformation} is any transformation that preserves the cross ratio. Specifically:

    \begin{definition}[Projective Transformations]
        A projective map $f$ is defined as a function $f:\mathcal{C}_1 \to \mathcal{C}_2$ (where $\mathcal{C}_1$ and $\mathcal{C}_2$ are both conics, lines or pencils of lines) such that for any 4 points $A, B, C, D \in \mathcal{C}_1$, \[(A, B; C, D) = (f(A), f(B); f(C), f(D))\]
    \end{definition}

    There are two useful results that would come in handy.

    \begin{theorem}[Projective Compositions]
        The composition $f \circ g$ of two projective functions $f$ and $g$ is projective.
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{theorem}[Inverse of a Projective Map]
        The inverse $f^{-1}$ of a projective map $f$ is also projective.
    \end{theorem}

    

    We give a few examples of common projective transformations below. These are taken from \href{https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c473124h1763266_moving_points_tutorial}{this blog post}.

    \section{The Method}
    The essence of the method of moving points boils down to one important theorem:
    \begin{theorem}
        hello
    \end{theorem}

    \begin{problem}[USA Winter TST for IMO 2019 Problem 1]
        Let $ABC$ be a triangle and let $M$ and $N$ denote the midpoints of $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{AC}$, respectively. Let $X$ be a point such that $\overline{AX}$ is tangent to the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$. Denote by $\omega_B$ the circle through $M$ and $B$ tangent to $\overline{MX}$, and by $\omega_C$ the circle through $N$ and $C$ tangent to $\overline{NX}$. Show that $\omega_B$ and $\omega_C$ intersect on line $BC$. \\\\
